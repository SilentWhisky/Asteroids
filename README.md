# Asteroids

~ This is a Phython project, building a small game to practice managing different python files
and practicing OOT.

~ The player is a tringle with a circle HITBOX.
~ Random astreoids with 3 different sizes spawn from random locations.
~ The player shoots small bullets that splits the asteroids, downsizing from large till it's small and gets killed.
